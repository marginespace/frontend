// ==================== VAULTS & STRATEGIES ====================
const vaultsAndStrategiesFaqConfig: IFaqDropdownItem[] = [
  {
    question: 'What are Vaults and how do they work?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Vaults are smart contracts that automatically manage your deposited assets to generate yield. Each vault implements a specific strategy that deposits your funds into DeFi protocols, earns rewards, harvests them, and reinvests (auto-compounds) to maximize returns.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you deposit into a vault, you receive receipt tokens (vault shares) representing your portion of the vault. These shares automatically increase in value as the vault compounds your earnings.
        </p>
        <p>
          All vaults are non-custodial – you maintain full control and can withdraw your funds at any time.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'What is auto-compounding?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Auto-compounding is the process of automatically harvesting earned rewards and reinvesting them back into the strategy to generate compound interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of you manually claiming rewards, paying gas fees, and reinvesting, our vaults do this automatically multiple times per day. This significantly increases your effective APY compared to manual compounding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The compounding frequency is optimized based on gas costs, TVL, and reward rates to ensure maximum efficiency.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the different vault types?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Margin Space offers several types of vaults:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-2">
          <li><strong>Single Asset Vaults:</strong> Deposit one token to earn yield (e.g., USDC, ETH)</li>
          <li><strong>LP Token Vaults:</strong> Deposit liquidity pool tokens from DEXs like Uniswap, SushiSwap, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Stable Vaults:</strong> Low-risk vaults focused on stablecoin strategies</li>
          <li><strong>Leveraged Vaults:</strong> Advanced strategies using leverage to amplify returns (higher risk)</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-Strategy Vaults:</strong> Diversified across multiple protocols for balanced risk/reward</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I choose the right vault?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Consider these factors when selecting a vault:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-2">
          <li><strong>APY:</strong> Higher APY often means higher risk</li>
          <li><strong>TVL (Total Value Locked):</strong> Higher TVL generally indicates more trust and stability</li>
          <li><strong>Risk Level:</strong> Check the strategy details and underlying protocols</li>
          <li><strong>Asset Type:</strong> Single asset vs LP tokens, stablecoins vs volatile assets</li>
          <li><strong>Platform Reputation:</strong> Established protocols (Aave, Curve) vs newer platforms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use our filters to narrow down vaults by asset type, platform, chain, and risk level. Always start with smaller deposits to test a strategy.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I withdraw anytime?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Yes! Standard vaults have no lock-up periods – you can deposit and withdraw at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, please note:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
          <li>Some promotional pools may have temporary lock-up periods for boosted rewards</li>
          <li>Gas fees apply for deposits and withdrawals</li>
          <li>Large withdrawals may experience slight slippage depending on the strategy</li>
        </ul>

  {
    question: 'What are Promotional Pools?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Promotional Pools are special time-limited opportunities where you can earn <strong>boosted rewards</strong> by depositing specific assets. These pools often feature:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
          <li>Higher APY than standard vaults</li>

  {
    question: 'What is BOOST and how do I get it?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          BOOST is a multiplier mechanism that increases your rewards in certain vaults and promotional pools.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can activate BOOST by:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
          <li>Staking platform governance tokens</li>
          <li>Holding specific NFTs or badges</li>
          <li>Participating in loyalty programs</li>
          <li>Early depositing in new pools</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Vaults with active BOOST are marked with an orange "BOOST" badge and typically offer 1.5x - 3x higher APY.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'How are rewards distributed?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Rewards are distributed in two ways:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Auto-compounded rewards:</strong> These are automatically harvested and reinvested into your position, increasing your vault share value. You realize these gains when you withdraw.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Claimable rewards:</strong> In promotional pools, additional rewards (like bonus tokens) may accumulate separately and need to be claimed manually from your Dashboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check your Dashboard regularly to see your total earnings and any claimable rewards.

// ==================== FEES & APY ====================
const feesAndApyFaqConfig: IFaqDropdownItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What's the difference between APR and APY?",
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          <strong>APR (Annual Percentage Rate)</strong> is the simple yearly return without compounding. It shows what you'd earn if rewards were paid out once per year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>APY (Annual Percentage Yield)</strong> includes the effect of compounding. Since our vaults auto-compound multiple times per day, the effective APY is significantly higher than APR.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> A vault with 100% APR compounded daily results in approximately 171% APY.
        </p>
        <p>
          All rates displayed on Margin Space are <strong>APY</strong> (already including compounding effects), showing you the real expected annual return.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'What fees does Margin Space charge?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Margin Space has a transparent fee structure:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-2">
          <li><strong>Performance Fee:</strong> % of earned profits (only charged on gains)</li>
          <li><strong>Withdrawal Fee:</strong> % varies by vault, typically waived after 72 hours</li>
          <li><strong>No deposit or management fees at the moment</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The protocol reserves the right to introduce adaptive fees in specific scenarios, such as:</strong> <ul>
            <li> - covering cross-chain transaction costs</li>  
            <li> - maintaining infrastructure sustainability</li>
            <li> - implementing third-party protocol integrations (e.g., Axelar, LayerZero)</li>
          </ul></li>  
        </ul>
        <p>
          All displayed APYs are <strong>net of fees</strong> – what you see is what you get.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gas fees for blockchain transactions are separate and paid directly to network validators, not to Margin Space.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do APY rates change?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          APY rates are dynamic and change based on several factors:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
          <li>Changes in underlying protocol reward rates</li>
          <li>Total deposits in the vault (higher TVL can dilute rewards)</li>
          <li>Market conditions and trading volumes</li>
          <li>Token price fluctuations</li>
          <li>Network congestion affecting gas optimization</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We update APY calculations in real-time to reflect current rates. Historical APY data is available on each vault's detail page.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there any hidden fees?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          No. Margin Space believes in complete transparency. All fees are clearly displayed:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
          <li>Performance fees are shown in vault details</li>
          <li>Withdrawal fees are displayed before confirming transactions</li>
          <li>Gas estimates are shown for all transactions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The APY you see already accounts for all platform fees. There are no hidden charges.

    question: 'What is Impermanent Loss?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Impermanent Loss (IL) occurs in liquidity pool (LP) vaults when the price ratio of paired assets changes compared to when you deposited.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> You deposit ETH/USDC LP tokens when ETH = $2,000. If ETH rises to $3,000, the LP automatically rebalances, selling some ETH for USDC. You end up with less ETH than if you had simply held it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mitigation:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
          <li>Choose stablecoin pairs (USDC/USDT) to minimize IL</li>
          <li>Use single-asset vaults to avoid IL entirely</li>
          <li>High APY can offset impermanent loss over time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          IL is called "impermanent" because it only becomes permanent when you withdraw. If prices return to original ratios, the loss disappears.

        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
          <li>Copy the vault token contract address (shown in vault details)</li>

  {
    question: 'What are vault share tokens?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          When you deposit assets into a vault, you receive vault share tokens (receipt tokens) that represent your portion of the vault's total holdings.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the vault earns and compounds rewards, the exchange rate of shares to underlying assets increases. When you withdraw, you burn your shares and receive back more of the underlying asset than you deposited.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> Deposit 100 USDC, receive 95 marginSpaceUSDC shares. Over time, 95 marginSpaceUSDC might be worth 105 USDC due to compounded earnings.

          However, keep in mind:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">

    question: 'What is TVL and why does it matter?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          <strong>TVL (Total Value Locked)</strong> is the total dollar value of all assets deposited in a vault or protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          TVL matters because:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
          <li><strong>Trust Indicator:</strong> Higher TVL suggests more users trust the vault</li>
          <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Larger vaults can handle bigger deposits/withdrawals smoothly</li>
          <li><strong>Reward Dilution:</strong> Sometimes very high TVL can reduce APY as rewards are shared among more users</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Larger vaults can optimize gas costs better</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Generally, vaults with TVL between $1M - $50M offer a good balance of trust and reward rates.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'How often are rewards harvested and compounded?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          Harvest frequency varies by vault and is dynamically optimized based on:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
          <li>Accumulated rewards (must exceed gas costs)</li>
          <li>Current gas prices (we wait for lower gas)</li>
          <li>Vault size (larger vaults compound more frequently)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Typically, vaults are harvested <strong>1-4 times per day</strong>. You can see the last harvest time on each vault's detail page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our keeper bots continuously monitor conditions and trigger harvests at optimal moments to maximize net returns.

  },
  {
    question: 'What happens during high gas fees?',
    answer: (
      <div className="flex w-full flex-col gap-4">
        <p>
          During high network congestion, Margin Space automatically adjusts:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-2">
          <li><strong>Harvest Delays:</strong> Waits for gas to drop before harvesting (avoids wasting profits on gas)</li>
          <li><strong>Batch Operations:</strong> Combines multiple actions in single transactions</li>
          <li><strong>Alternative Routes:</strong> Uses Layer 2 or alternative chains when possible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For users, we recommend:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
          <li>Use Layer 2 chains (Arbitrum, Optimism) for lower fees</li>
          <li>Deposit larger amounts to amortize gas costs</li>
          <li>Avoid transactions during peak hours (check gas trackers)</li>
        </ul>
