                When you receive the Staking Reward, we shall charge our fees for your use of our
                Platform (the "Staking fees"). The amount of Staking fees to be charged by us
                depends on: (i) type of Digital asset placed in Staking, (ii) the supported
                protocol of the Digital asset used for Staking, (iii) duration of Staking and (iv)
                discretion of the Platform. Staking fees are described at Fees Template
                (https://app.marginspace.com).

                The Platform doesn't provide any subscription or similar services that undertakes
                payment of regular scheduled fees. We don't accept payment in Fiat currencies and
                don't accept deposits from you. The Staking fees are calculated in the percentage of
                the Staking Reward and are automatically charged in the same Digital assets as were
                placed for Staking when you receive Staking Reward on your Digital wallet.

                any other term or condition, and any failure of the Platform to assert a right or
                provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
